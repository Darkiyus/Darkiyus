# Hello, I'm 
<img src="/Darkiyus-Banner.gif" alt="Darkiyus-Banner"> 
I am 23 years old and love to create stuff.
No matter if programming, videos, graphics or other stuff.

I started programming 4-5 years ago with the programming language C++.
Since then I have sometimes more, sometimes less busy with programming, depending on how the desire and mood was there.

I love variety, organization and creativity...so exactly that what actually makes me.

My dream is or in the future I want to develop a lot of great games that are unique and full of fun.

Oh, and I'm really bad at English
